    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Authors: Tarra K-Co, Anthony Giang, Simon Tran, Yutao Wang<br /><br />
      We want to make it easier for people to find services that they<br />
      need and can easily make a detour for, on their trips from A to B.<br />
      Many people spend time across multiple apps in order to gather all<br />
      the information they need to plan their route.Thus what we aim to
      provide<br />
      is a convenient, click/tap and go service which will save people’s time
      and effort.<br />
    </p>
    <h4>How to use this web app:</h4>
    <p>
      The user chooses the starting and destination points,<br />
      and the service category or categories they want on the way<br />
      (convenient stores, parking, toilets, restaurants, gas stations, etc).<br />
      Once selected, the user selects the specific places they want to visit<br />
      from their chosen categories.The app then generates<br />
      a route from start to destination with detours to selected<br />
      services on the way. The “detours/on the way” functionality is<br />
      the main feature of the web application.
