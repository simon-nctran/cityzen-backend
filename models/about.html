    <H1>About us</H1>
    <p>Authors: Tarra K-Co, Anthony Giang, Simon Tran, Yutao Wang</p>
    <pre>We want to make it easier for people to find services that they
    need and can easily make a detour for, on their trips from A to B.
    Many people spend time across multiple apps in order to gather all
    the information they need to plan their route.Thus what we aim to provide is
    a convenient, click/tap and go service which will save people’s time and effort.</pre>
    <H2>How to use this web app:</H2>
    <pre>The user chooses the starting and destination points,
    and the service category or categories they want on the way
    (convenient stores, parking, toilets, restaurants, gas stations, etc).
    Once selected, the user selects the specific places they want to visit
    from their chosen categories.The app then generates
    a route from start to destination with detours to selected
    services on the way. The “detours/on the way” functionality is
    the main feature of the web application.</pre>
